"seasonOutlook":"Lux forced his way into the Dodgers' September and postseason plans thanks to .347/.421/.607 rates, 26 HRs
 and 10 SBs in 113 games combined between Double-A Tulsa and Triple-A Oklahoma City, flashing enough pop in the process to
 put himself  in the mix at 2B entering spring training. While that will be a battle, his blue-chip prospect status might 
earn him an edge, assuming the Dodgers don't want to keep his service time in check. Make no mistake, Lux can rake. 
He's the kind of player with easy top-10 potential at second base if he's in an everyday role, but
 his base stealing comes with some questions, as he was only 52-for-77 during his minor league career. He's a top 
dynasty/keeper-league prospect, and one who could settle in the top 100 in redraft leagues if he's looking good during
 spring training.",
